#Who to trust

#Greetings
Captain?

#Busy
Oh, I'm sorry. i've got work to do, I can't talk right now.

#Violent answer
Aaugh! *Grunts* You can't trust any sailor. But, at the end of the day, <stingy> is my mate.

#Peaceful answer
I trust who I can get to know. Maybe he's not the most honest man but, at the end of the day, <stingy> is my mate.

#Briving answer
Extra payment, for a treat! I trust <stingy>, though he's not the most honest man. At the end of the day, he's my mate.
