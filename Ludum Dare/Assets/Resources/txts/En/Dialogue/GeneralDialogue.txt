#Questions

#First message
- English - You've overheard a rumor that a mutiny is brewing on your boat. You'd better find who's the culprit of this treachery, or you'll be walking the plank. You have 5 days before reaching the next port, where the treason will occur.

#Who's the traitor
Today might be a good day to take a more direct approach. You let your crew in your cabinet, and ask, one by one: "Can you tell me who's the traitor in this boat?".

#Who lies
Goddamn bunch of liars... no one seems to agree with no one else. Today, you scream "Who of you bastards is lying to me?!"

#Who can I trust
You don't know what to think anymore... so today, you ask: "Tell me who can I trust the most in this boat".

#Would you lie to me
Today, you decide to ask a simple question. One by one, you approach them, look them in the eye and ask: "Would you lie to me?".

#Last day
No more time. One last time, you let them in, with your gun loaded at your side. You've gotta make a choice. It's you, or him.

#Trying to do a "questionable action" (Agression, brive) with no power left
You think you shouldn't abuse your power here. Better wait some time before doing some more... \"questionable\" actions.

#First time
Do you think this tricks of yours will work on me? Hmpf! Don't you dare try that again, or i will be forced to leave.

#Second time
That's it! I don't have to take this anymore. Next stop we make, i'm leaving. I don't have to take orders from some captain wannabe.

#Not talking anymore
