#Greetings
My Lord?

#Busy
Oh, I'm sorry. i've got work to do, I can't talk right now.

#Violent answer
Oy, hey, stop!  I don’t know who it could be, like this, with all this tension… it doesn’t come to mind, no. I just can’t put my finger on it…

#Peaceful answer
What? I don’t… don’t recall. Strange, but it doesn’t come to mind. Maybe… nope, right now I got nothing, no. Nothing.

#Briving answer
Oh… it’s so shiny, don’t ya think? If ya ask me this nicely I tell ya mate! Wherever there’s trouble there’s <rioter>, ain’t that strange?
