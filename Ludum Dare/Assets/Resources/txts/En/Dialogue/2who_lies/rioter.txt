#Greetings
My Lord?

#Busy
Oh, I'm sorry. i've got work to do, I can't talk right now.

#Violent answer
Gggh... <comrad> is lying to you, sir. He‘s playing dumb. You've been warned...

#Peaceful answer
It’s hard to know these things for sure. But <stingy> has never been trustworthy. He is lying to you, sir!

#Briving answer
Good coins! <sea_wolf> is so agressive and rude… and he wants to be the new Captain! He will do whatever it takes to get what he wants.
