#Violent answer
Alright, alright, I know what’s coming. Let’s skip that part and I’ll just answer ya. Maybe I’ve said some little white lie at some point, nothin’ personal sir… Don’t hit me!

#Peaceful answer
No, sir, yours truly don’t lie. Maybe, beat, rob, drink and cheat. But lie? No, I never lie.

#Briving answer
Ka-ching! No, sir, yours truly don’t lie. Maybe, beat, rob, drink and cheat. But lie? No, I never lie.
