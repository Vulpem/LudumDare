#Would you lie to me

#Greetings
You called for me?

#Busy
Oh, I'm sorry. i've got work to do, I can't talk right now.

#Violent answer
Ooooow, why you gotta be like that sir? I didn’t lie to you! I’ve been an orphan since I lost my parents…they died ‘cause of lyin’, so I keep to the truth with all me might.

#Peaceful answer
Me sir? Noo, never! My momma taught me good, e’vr since I was a wee lad I know that liars get taken by the sea.

#Briving answer
Me sir? Noo, never! A childhood mate and an old lass o’ mine lied to me years ago. Since then I nev’r sink down to that level.
