#Who's the traitor

#Greetings
You called for me?

#Busy
Oh, I'm sorry. i've got work to do, I can't talk right now.

#Violent answer
Augh...okay, okay, I'll tell you! <comrad> wants to trick you... but you didn’t hear it from me!

#Peaceful answer
I can't say I'm sure about it....but I'd bet it’s <sea_wolf>.

#Briving answer
This bonus will suit me well this month... Don't trust <brute>, if I were you I'd keep an eye on him.
