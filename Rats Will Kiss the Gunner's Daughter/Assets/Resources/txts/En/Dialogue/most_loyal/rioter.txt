#Last day

#Greetings
Am I needed?

#Busy
Oh, I'm sorry. i've got work to do, I can't talk right now.

#Violent answer
Aarhg... Don't be like that... The one who never lies is <brute>.

#Peaceful answer
Well, I feel a little bit ashamed to say but.. that would be me, sir. The Captain deserves to be respected.

#Briving answer
This will suit me well. I am the most loyal sailor, sir. I like money, but that doesn't mean that I lie when I’m not paid.
